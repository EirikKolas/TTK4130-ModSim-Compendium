\section{Frame Transformations}
The subscript $b$ of $r_b^a$ denotes the body the vector $r$ is representing, and the superscript $a$ denotes the frame the vector is in. 

Another notation that is used is to write a vector as $r_{b/O_a}$, which means the position $r$ of body $b$ in relation to the origin $O$ of the $a$ frame. Graphically this represents an arrow from the origin of $a$ to the body $b$.

Let the vector $\vec{v}$ have coordinate vector $v^b$ in $b$ and coordinate vector $v^a$ in $a$. Then the transformation matrix $\mathbf T_b^a$ transforms the coordinate vector in $b$ to the coordinate vector in $a$ according to
$$
v^a=\mathbf T_b^a v^b
$$
